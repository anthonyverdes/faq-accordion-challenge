## My process

### Built with

- Svelte / SvelteKit
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this challenge I learned the basic workflow of using Svelte and understanding the project structure. I simply created a separate data file for the FAQ content and pulled it into the main page. Nothing crazy but learning how to use Svelte's file structure and conditional markup.

### Continued development

I really enjoyed working with Svelte so far and would like to continue exploring its way of doing things in future challenges.
